## Biography

Landry Bretheau is Assistant Professor at Ecole Polytechnique (IP Paris). He graduated from Ecole Polytechnique (X2005) and carried out his Ph.D. at the CEA Saclay. He then conducted two successive post-docs at ENS (France) and MIT (USA). Since 2017, he has been building-up a new lab – the QCMX Lab – together with his colleague Jean-Damien Pillet, which explores the physics of Hybrid Quantum Circuits. To develop this new activity, Landry Bretheau was awarded a Young Team Fellowship from École Polytechnique, a Young Researcher Grant from the French National Research Agency and an ERC Starting Grant from the European Research Council. His work has led to major contributions in the fields of Mesoscopic Superconductivity and Quantum Circuits, with the publication of articles in the scientific journals Nature, Science, and Physical Review and was awarded the École Polytechnique Thesis Award as well as the 2020 Nicholas Kurti Science Prize.
